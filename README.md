Project 1: Nebraska Air Quality Analysis (February 2024 - March 2025)
Project Overview
This project was commissioned by the UNMC Water, Climate and Health Group to analyze air quality data across Nebraska. As air quality is not a primary specialty of the UNMC working group, this analysis serves to provide data-driven insights into how pollutants like Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Particulate Matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10.0) impact public health across the state
The primary objective is to identify air quality "hotspots," evaluate compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and understand how environmental variables—such as temperature, humidity, and altitude—influence pollutant concentrations.
Objectives and Client Requests
The following core questions and tasks were addressed in this analysis:
Top Pollutant Locations: Identify the 5 locations in Nebraska with the highest mean and median concentrations of VOC, PM 2.5, and PM 10.0.
Peak Events: Determine the dates and locations of maximum pollutant values and research potential causes for these occurrences.
Environmental Correlation: Analyze the effect of humidity and temperature categories on air quality
AQI Risk Assessment: Identify instances where Air Quality Index (AQI) levels reached "Unhealthy for Sensitive Populations" or higher for PM 2.5 and PM 10.
Altitude Impact: Evaluate if sensor altitude has a statistically relevant impact on air quality readings.
